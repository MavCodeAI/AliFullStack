# 🧠 AliFullStack — AI-Powered Full-Stack App Builder

**AliFullStack** is a local-first, AI-driven full-stack app builder that empowers you to build, test, and deploy applications with speed, privacy, and full control. Inspired by tools like Lovable, v0, and Bolt, AliFullStack runs entirely in your browser or on your machine — no vendor lock-in, no data leakage.

Built on top of [Dyad](https://www.alifullstack.alitech.io), it brings together the power of modern AI models with the flexibility of your favorite frontend and backend frameworks.
